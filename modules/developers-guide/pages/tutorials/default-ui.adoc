The canister interface description language—often referred to as Candid or more generally as the IDL—provides a common syntax for specifying input arguments and return values.
The language performs automatic type mapping so you can use the same syntax to interact with the `+dfx+` command-line interface, JavaScript, {proglang}, and other supported languages or tools.

The language can also automatically generate a default web interface that exposes your program's functions for testing and debugging.

This tutorial illustrates how to view and use the default web interface that the canister interface language generates.

NOTE: This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions independent of any other tutorials. 
If you have already built and deployed a canister and know the current canister identifier, you can skip directly to <<Viewing the default web interface>>.

== Before you begin

* You have downloaded and installed the SDK as described in link:../getting-started{outfilesuffix}[Getting started].
* You have stopped any network client processes running on the local computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new default_web_ui
----
. Change to your new `+default_web_ui+` project directory.
+
For this tutorial, you can leave the default `dfx.json` configuration file and `+main.mo+` program files unchanged.

== Build and deploy the program

To build the program executable:

. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
. Deploy your `+default_web_ui+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install default_web_ui
----
. Copy the canister identifier that begins with the `+ic:+` prefix displayed.

== Viewing the default web interface

To view the web interface:

. Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
By default, the URL uses the localhost address (`+127.0.0.1+`) and port number `+8000+`, so you can navigate to the front-end for the hello_world program using `+127.0.0.1:8000+` for the URL.
. Append the candid keyword the canister identifier after the host address and port number using the following syntax:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
candid?canisterId=ic:canister_identifier
----
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the `+ic:_canister_identifier_+` that was returned by the `+dfx canister install+` command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
http://localhost:8000/candid?canisterId=ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Review the list of function calls and types defined in the program.
+
For example, the default program includes one `+greet+` function that takes a text argument:
+
image:candid-ui.png[Viewing functions calls]

== Testing function calls

To test the functions defined in your program:

. Type a value of the appropriate type, then click *Call* to see the result.
+
For example:
+
image:candid-ui-return.png[Greeting result]
. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
