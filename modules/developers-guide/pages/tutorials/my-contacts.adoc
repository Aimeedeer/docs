Cascading stylesheets represent one of the most ways to customize the user experience for an application.
This tutorial illustrates how to add a stylesheet when you use React to create a new front-end for your project. 
If you already know how to add cascading stylesheets (CSS) to a React-based project, you can skip this tutorial.

NOTE: Currently, you can only use Javascript to implement the front-end for your canister. 
This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to manage the Document Object Model (DOM) for your canister.
Because React has its own custom DOM syntax, you need to modify the webpack configuration to compile the front-end code, which is written in JSX. For more information about learning to use React and JSX, see link:https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[Getting started] on the https://reactjs.org/[React website].

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for your custom front-end application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Verify that you have `+node.js+` installed locally, if necessary.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new contacts
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd contacts
----
. Install the React module and required loaders by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
npm install --save typescript ts-loader css-loader
----
+
if you've never used React before, you might want to explore the link:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html[Intro to React] tutorial or the link:https://reactjs.org/[React website] before editing the front-end code.
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
+
For this tutorial:
+
* Change the entry file name to `+index.jsx+` to enable adding HTML directly inside Javascript as a template.
* Change the name of the main program file to `+contacts.mo+`.
+
You should also note that the `serve_root` setting specifies the path to a directory for static assets that will be included in your canister when you build your project.
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+src/contacts+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/contacts
----
. Rename the `+main.mo+` file as `+contacts.mo+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv main.mo contacts.mo
----
. Open the `+contacts.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$mycontacts/contacts.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+contacts.mo+` file to continue.

== Modify the front-end files

You are now ready to create a new front-end for the default program.

. Navigate back to the root of your project directory.
. Open the webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) in a text editor to add the following `+module+` key above the `+plugins+` section:
+
[source,bash]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
    { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader' 'css-loader'] }
  ]
},
----
+
These settings enable your program to use the `+ts-loader+` compiler and to import CSS files.
. Save your changes and close the `+contacts.mo+` file to continue.
. Create a new file named `+tsconfig.json+`, open the file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file:
+
[source,bash]
----
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "es2018",        /* Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5', 'ES2015', 'ES2016', 'ES2017', 'ES2018', 'ES2019' or 'ESNEXT'. */
      "module": "commonjs",      /* Specify module code generation: 'none', 'commonjs', 'amd', 'system', 'umd', 'es2015', or 'ESNext'. */
      "lib": ["ES2018", "DOM"],  /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */
      "allowJs": true,           /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */
      "jsx": "react",            /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */
    }
}
----
. Save your changes and close the `+tsconfig.json+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+contacts/src/contacts/public+` directory.
. Open the default `+index.js+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+index.js+` file:
+
[source,react]
....
include::example$my-contacts/mod-index.jsx[]
....
. Rename the modified `index.js` file as `index.jsx` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
mv index.js index.jsx
----

== Build the program

You are now ready to compile the program with the new front-end as part of the WebAssembly module.

To build the program with the new front-end:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Navigate to the root of your `+contacts+` project folder.
+
Note that this step is required because you must run the `+dfx build+` command from within the project directory structure.
. Build the executable canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
[source,bash]
----
Building canister contacts
Building frontend
Bundling frontend assets in the canister
----

== Start the local network and deploy

You now have a program that can be deployed on your local client network.

To deploy the program on your local network:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+contacts+` project directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Deploy your `+contacts+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
+
The command output displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister contacts, with canister_id ic:19F69036D7308B0DEE
----

== Viewing the front-end

. Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
By default, the URL uses the localhost address (`+127.0.0.1+`) and port number `+8000+`, so you can navigate to the front-end for the hello_world program using `+127.0.0.1:8000+` for the URL.
+
In addition to the host and port, the URL you specify needs to include `+canisterId+` parameter to identify the canister that you want the web server to display. 
To specify the canister, append the identifier using the following syntax:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
?canisterId=ic:canister_identifier
----
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the `+ic:_canister_identifier_+` that was returned by the `+dfx canister install+` command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:react-greeting.png[Sample front-end]
. Replace *Name* in the input field with the text you want to display, then click *Get Greeting* to see the result.
+
For example:
+
image:greeting-response.png[Greeting result]

== Revise the front-end and test your changes

After viewing the front-end, you might want to make some changes.

To modify the front-end:

. Open the `index.jsx` file in a text editor and modify its style settings.
For example, you might want to change the font family and use a placeholder for the input field by making changes similar to the following:
+
[source,react]
....
include::example$react-revised-index.jsx[]
....
. Rebuild the project with your changes by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Deploy your project changes and note your new canister identifier.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install custom_greeting
----
. View the results in the browser by changing the URL to use the new canister identifier.
+
For example:
+
image:revised-greeting.png[Modified styles on your entry page]
. Type a new message and see your new greeting.
For example:
+
image:modified-result.png[Modified greeting result]
+
In the background, the {IC} process logs the message request and creates a new checkpoint.
+
[source,bash]
----
Feb 04 19:57:29.100 INFO Successfully inserted an ingress message into IngressPool, Application: P2P/ArtifactPool
Feb 04 19:57:29.273 INFO Created checkpoint @246690 in 25.547581ms, StateManager: 1
----
. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
