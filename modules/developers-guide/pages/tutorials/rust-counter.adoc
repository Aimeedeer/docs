In this tutorial, you are going to write a program that provides a few basic functions to increment a counter and illustrates the persistence of a value.

For this tutorial, the program declares a `+COUNTER+` as a mutable variable to contain a natural number that represents the current value of the counter.
This program supports the following functions:

* The `+increment+` function updates the current value, incrementing by 1 with no return value.
* The `+get+` function is a simple query that returns the current value of the counter.
* The `+set+` function updates the current value to the numeric value you specify as an argument.

This tutorial provides a simple example of how you can increment a counter by calling functions on a deployed canister.
By calling the function to increment a value multiple times, you can verify that the variable state—that is, the value of the variable between calls—persists.

Like the other sample programs, this tutorial demonstrates a simple, but realistic, workflow in which you perform the following steps:

* Create a new project.
* Write a program that compile into a WebAssembly module.
* Deploy the canister on the local {IC} network.
* Invoke the canister methods to increment then read the value of a counter.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].
* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new rust_counter
----
+
The command creates a new `+rust_counter+` project and Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd rust_counter
----

== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----

----
+
. Save your change and close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.

== Add a Cargo.toml file to the project

To add a Cargo.toml configuration file:

. in the project root directory
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/rust_counter",
]

== Modify the default program

The next step is to replace the default source code in the `+src/rust_counter/main.mo+` file with a Rust program that defines an actor named `+Counter+` and implements the `+increment+`, `+get+`, and `+set+` functions.

To modify the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Rename the default `+src/rust_counter/main.mo+` file to use the Rust file extensionby running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv src/rust_counter/main.mo src/rust_counter/counter.rs
----
. Open the `+src/rust_counter/counter.rs+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+counter.rs+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$counter.rs[]
----
+
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Add a Cargo.toml file to the project

. in the src/rust_counter directory

~/RUST-CDK/rust_counter (master)$ vi src/rust_counter/Cargo.toml 

[package]
name = "rust_counter"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["DFINITY <support@dfinity.org>"]
edition = "2018"

[lib]
path = "counter.rs"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic_cdk = { path = "../../../../src/ic_cdk", version = "0.1.0" }
ic_cdk_macros = { path = "../../../../src/ic_cdk_macros", version = "0.1.0" }
ic-types = "0.1.1"
candid = "0.6.4"
lazy_static = "1.4.0"

== Add a Candid interface description file


== Start the network and deploy locally

Before you can build the `+rust_counter+` project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/rust_counter+` in the new terminal if your `+rust_counter+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have two terminals open with your project directory as your current working directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
After you start the local network, the terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open.
. Switch to your second terminal window or tab.
. Register, build, and deploy the canister for the project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----

== Invoke functions on the deployed canister

After successfully deploying the canister, you can test the canister by invoking the functions it provides.
For this tutorial:

* Invoke the `+get+` function to query the value of the counter.
* Invoke the `+increment+` function to increment the counter each time it is called.
* Invoke the `+set+` function to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify.

To test invoking methods on the deployed canister:

[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+get+` function, which reads the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable as zero:
+
....
(0)
....
[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+increment+` function to increment the value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister by one:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
----
+
This command increments the value of the variable—changing its state—but does not return the result.
[arabic]
. Rerun the following command to get the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the updated value of the `+currentValue+` variable as one:
+
....
(1)
....
[arabic]
. Run additional commands to experiment with invoking other methods and using different values.
+
For example, try commands similar to the following to set and return the counter value:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter set '(987)'
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the current value of 987.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the incremented value of 988.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
