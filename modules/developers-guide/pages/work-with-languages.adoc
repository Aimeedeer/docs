= Working with different languages

Most of the examples in this guide use {proglang}â€”the programming language specifically designed to work with the {IC}. 
Potentially, however, you can write programs in any language that compiles to WebAssembly to deploy applications that run on the {IC}.
This section provides some high-level guidance for writing programs in different languages for deployment on the {IC}.

== Using Rust


== Using C

You can find some examples of programs written in C++ in the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/c[examples] repository.
