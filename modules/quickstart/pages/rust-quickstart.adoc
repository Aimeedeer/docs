[[quick-start-intro]]
This {cdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on the {IC} network.
This _Quick start_ assumes that you are installing the {cdk-short-name} for the first time. 

To help you get started, this tutorial illustrates how to modify the traditional "Hello World" first program to use the {cdk-short-name}. 
This simple program has just one function that prints text to a terminal, but it provides a good model for understanding the workflow when writing programs in Rust that you want to deploy on the {IC}.


[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install the {cdk-long-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have downloaded and installed the Rust programming language and Cargo as described in link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html[Installation].

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-long-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local computer.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers]. 
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[download-and-install]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {cdk-long-name} from the link:https://crates.io/[Rust community’s crate registry] or the link:https://github.com/dfinity/rust-cdk[Rust CDK] repository.

To download and install:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {cdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You can create new projects for the {IC} using either Cargo or the {sdk-short-name}.
Becuase you are building this project to be deployed on the {IC}, this tutorial focuses on how to create, build, and deploy a Rust program by using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
However, creating a new project with `+cargo new+` adds some default files to the project directory structure—such as the `+Cargo.lock+` and `+Cargo.toml+` files—that you will need in your development environment.

* If you decide to use Cargo to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that the {cdk-long-name} requires.
* If you decide to use {sdk-short-name} to create your project, you will need to manually add some files that Cargo requires.

To create a new project using the {sdk-short-name}:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+rust_hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new rust_hello
----
+
The `+dfx new rust_hello+` command creates a new `+rust_hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+rust_hello+` Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd rust_hello
----

== Modify the default configuration

Creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
This file contains settings required to build a project for the {IC} much like the `+Cargo.toml+` file provides build and package management configuration details for Rust programs.
You need to modify the default settings in both of these files to build Rust programs that run on the {IC} as canisters.

=== Edit canister settings

To modify the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Notice that under the `+canisters+` key, you have some default settings for the `+rust_hello+` canister such as the default path to the main program file and a default type of `+motoko+`.
. Replace the `+canisters.rust_hello.main+` key and setting with a `+canisters.rust_hello.build+` key and specify the `+cargo build+` command to execute.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"build": "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package rust_hello",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.candid+` key and specify the location of the Candid interface description file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"candid": "src/rust_hello/rust_hello.did",
----
. Add a `+canisters.rust_hello.wasm+` key and specify the location of the compiled WebAssembly file to use for the canister.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"wasm": "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/rust_hello.wasm",
----
. Modify the `+canisters.rust_hello.type+` key and specify `+custom+` as the canister type.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
"type": "custom"
----
. Remove all of the `+rust_hello_assets+` configuration settings from the file.
+
The sample program for this tutorial doesn't use any front-end assets, so you can remove those settings from the configuration file.
+
For example, the configuration file looks like this after you remove the `+actor_hello_assets+` section:
+
....
include::example$rust-dfx.json[]
....
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Edit Cargo settings

To modify the `+Cargo.toml+` configuration file:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Create a new file named `+Cargo.toml+` if you created the project using `+dfx+` or open the default `+Cargo.toml+` file if you created the project using Cargo.
. Use the [workspace] key to specify the source file directories for your program.
+
For example:
+
[source,toml]
----
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/rust_hello",
]
----
. Change to the source code directory for your program.
+
For example:
[source,bash]
----
cd  src/rust_hello
----
. Create a second file named `+Cargo.toml+` and open it in a text editor.
. Configure settings for your project.
+
At a minimum, you need to configure `+[package]+`, `+[lib]+`, and `+[dependencies]+` settings with basic information about the package name, location of the main program to compile, and the location of the {cdk-short-name} libraries.
+
For example, you should have a Cargo.toml file with settings similar to the following for this tutorial:
+
[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "rust_hello"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You Name <your-email@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[lib]
path = "main.rs"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
ic_cdk = { path = "../rust-cdk/src/ic_cdk", version = "0.1.0" }
ic_cdk_macros = { path = "../rust-cdk/src/ic_cdk_macros", version = "0.1.0" }
candid = "0.2.4"
candid_derive = "0.2.1"
serde = "1.0.111"
----

== Replace the default program

Creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.
In this tutorial, you replace that file with a main.rs file to create a simple "Hello World" program.

To replace the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in the source code directory, if needed.
. Rename the template `+main.mo+` file to main.rs by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv main.mo main.rs
----
. Open the template `+main.rs+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Write a simple `+print+` function that uses the {cdk-short-name} `+query+` macro.
+
For example:
+
[source,rust]
----
#[ic_cdk_macros::query]
fn print() {
    ic_cdk::print("Hello World from DFINITY!");
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Add an interface description file


[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build your first project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

As a best practice, this step requires you to have **two terminal shells** open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Navigate back to the root directory of your project.
. Open a new second terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/hello+` in the new terminal if your `+hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in your second terminal by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal window that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the first terminal window where you created your new project.
+
You perform all of the remaining project-related steps in this terminal.

[[register-ids]]
== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique canister identifiers for your project.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the `+hello+` project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----

[[build-the-project]]
== Build the program

Your new `+hello+` project includes a simple default program in the `+src/hello+` directory that you can compile.

To build the program executable:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
. Build the executable from the default main program file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Verify the command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
....
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
....

[[deploy]]
== Deploy your program locally

The `+dfx build+` command created several artifacts in a `canisters` directory for your project. 
You now have a compiled program that can be deployed on your local {IC} network.

To deploy locally:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Deploy the default program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
+
You should see an installation confirmation message for your canister similar to the following:
+
....
Installing code for canister hello, with canister_id ic:03000000000000000000000000000000000179
Installing code for canister hello_assets, with canister_id ic:040000000000000000000000000000000001AF
....
. Call the predefined `+greet+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello greet everyone
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "everyone" as an argument to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end pop-up window using your web browser.

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the default address and port number `+127.0.0.1:8000+`, then append `+/?canisterId=+` and the identifier for the `+hello_assets+` canister to the URL:
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=ic:02000000000000000000000000000000000153
....
. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:quickstart-greeting.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]
. Click *OK* to close the pop-up alert window.

== Stop the local network

After testing the application in the browser, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local {IC} network running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
