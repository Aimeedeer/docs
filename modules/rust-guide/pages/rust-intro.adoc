:cdk: Rust Canister Development Kit (CDK)

Rust is a powerful and type sound modern programming language with an active developer community.
Because Rust compiles to WebAssembly, it offers a rich development environment for writing applications to run on the {IC}.
TO help pave the way for writing applications in Rust that can be deployed on the {IC}, {company} provides some tools to simplify the process.

Collectively, these tools are referred to as the {cdk} and consist of the following main libraries:

* `+ic_types+`
* `+ic_agent+`
* `+ic_utils+`
* `+ic_cdk+`
* `+ic_cdk_macros+`
* `+ic_cdk_optimizer+`

The following diagram provides a simplified view of the {cdk} building blocks from the lowest to highest level of abstraction.
